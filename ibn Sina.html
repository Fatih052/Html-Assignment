<center> <p> "He wrote prolifically on a wide range of subjects. He is thought to have created over 400 works on various topics but only about half have made it though time.<br>
 Forty of his medical texts have survived, including one of the most significant books in the history of medicine called <u><b>Canon of Medicine,</b></u>. <br>It was printed in Europe at least 60 times between 1516 and 1574. The Canon remained a major authority for medical students in both the Islamic world and Europe until well into the 1700s."</p>


  <center> <h3> Here's a time line of Ibnu-Sina-Avicenna`s life:</h3></center>

  <ul>

    <li style="text-align:left; "> <b>c. 980</b> - Abu Ali al-Husayn ibn Abdullah ibn Sina (or Ibn Sina for short) was born in Afshana, a village near Bukhara (present day Uzbekistan), capital of the Samanids, a Persian dynasty in Central Asia.</li><br>

    <li style="text-align:left; "> Around 10 years old he had memorized the entire Qur'an. </li><br>

    <li style="text-align:left; "> As a teenager he studied Aristotle's Metaphysics which had difficulty understanding.<br> He also studied philosophy with even greater difficulty understanding. 
    He also studied medicine with various teachers.Around 10 years old he had memorized the entire Qur'an. </li><br>

    <li style="text-align:left; "> At 16 he was established as a physician by his own account and discovered new methods of treatment </li><br>

    <li style="text-align:left; "> At 18 he achieved full status as a qualified physician, also from his own account, and quoted with: "Medicine is no hard and thorny science, like mathematics and metaphysics, 
    so I soon made great progress; <br>I began to treat patients, using approved remedies." The youthful physician's fame spread quickly. </li><br>

    <li style="text-align:left; "> Around early 1000 his father passed away and political turmoil in 1002 was ripe so he was forced to leave Bukhara and went to Urganj (present-day Konye-Urgench) in today’s Uzbekistan. </li><br>

     <li style="text-align:left;"> In 1012, out of necessity he moved to Gurgan (Jurjan or Gorgan) in Khurasan in search for a patron.
     He also started working on the Canon of Medicine which is his most famous work. He first met his disciple and scribe Juzjani. </li><br>

      <li style="text-align:left; "> In 1013 he moved to Rai near the present-day Tehran to work as a physician. </li><br>

       <li style="text-align:left; "> 1015 - He arrived in Hamadan where he settled down. He became vizier of Shams al-Dawla. After the latter's death in 1021, Avicenna once again sought a patron and became the vizier of the Kakuyid ‘Ala’ al-Dawla for whom he wrote an important <br>Persian summa of philosophy,
        the Danishnama-yi ‘Ala’i (The Book of Knowledge for ‘Ala’ al-Dawla). In Hamadan, he established himself as a philosopher and physician, and wrote his greatest works.
         However, after the death of the emir of Hamadan,<br> Avicenna wrote to the ruler of Isfahan and offered his service. When the new Hamadan emir found out about his letter, he had him imprisoned. He was eventually released but he decided to flee. </li><br>

        <li style="text-align:left; "> 1025 - He arrived in Isfahan disguised as Sufi ascetics, along with his brother, a student and two slaves. They left Hamadan and arrived in Isfahan and were warmly welcomed by the city's ruler.<br> He spent his last years in a relative peace, serving the city as the advisor of Isfahan's ruler and physician. </li><br>
     </ul>   

        <h3 style="text-align:left; "> Death </h3>

        <p style="text-align:left; "> He died from severe colic in 1037 at 58 years of age.</p>
